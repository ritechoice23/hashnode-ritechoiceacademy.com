I bring to you another piece about what you need to watch out for to ensure your system remains fast, reliable, and scalable.

Optimizing a backend system starts with understanding how it performs. But performance isn’t just about speed—it’s about reliability, efficiency, and scalability. Tracking the right metrics helps you catch potential issues before they become real problems. So, what should you actively monitor?

### 1\. Throughput (Requests Per Second)

Throughput tells you how many requests your API can handle at any given time. If your system can serve 1,000 requests per second but suddenly drops to 500, you know something’s wrong. A drop in throughput usually means bottlenecks—maybe your database is slow, your services aren’t scaling well, or your infrastructure needs optimization.

### 2\. Response Time (Latency)

How long does it take for your API to respond? Users expect fast interactions, so if your response time starts creeping up, it's a sign that something isn’t running efficiently. Slow responses can be caused by:

* Heavy database queries
    
* External API dependencies
    
* Insufficient server resources
    
* Poorly optimized application code
    

Tracking both average and percentile response times (p95, p99) helps you understand how most users experience your service, not just the best-case scenario.

### 3\. Payload Size

The amount of data your API sends in each response matters. Large payloads slow down requests, increase bandwidth usage, and degrade performance on slower networks. To optimize:

* Return only the necessary fields (avoid over-fetching data).
    
* Use compression (e.g., Gzip, Brotli) to shrink response sizes.
    
* Consider pagination for large data sets.
    

### 4\. Uptime & Stability

If your service is down, nothing else matters. Measuring uptime helps you track reliability. While a 99.9% uptime sounds great, it still means almost 9 hours of downtime per year. If you notice frequent crashes, you need to investigate:

* Are there infrastructure issues?
    
* Is your server hitting resource limits?
    
* Is your load balancer misconfigured?
    

Setting up monitoring tools to alert you when downtime happens ensures you can act quickly.

### 5\. CPU Usage

Your backend needs processing power to run, but excessive CPU usage can slow things down. High CPU usage during peak traffic might indicate poor scalability, while consistently high CPU under normal load suggests inefficient code execution. You should:

* Profile your application to identify CPU-intensive operations.
    
* Optimize slow functions or queries.
    
* Scale up your infrastructure if needed.
    

### 6\. Memory Usage

If your application keeps consuming more and more memory over time, you might have a memory leak. This can cause performance degradation or even crashes. To prevent this:

* Monitor memory usage trends over time.
    
* Ensure objects and database connections are properly released.
    
* Use caching wisely—too much caching can lead to excessive memory consumption.
    

Monitoring performance isn’t about collecting numbers—it’s about understanding how your backend behaves under real-world conditions. By keeping an eye on these key metrics, you can spot issues early, optimize where needed, and ensure your system remains fast, reliable, and scalable.
