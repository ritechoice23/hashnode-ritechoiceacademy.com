Reading through my previous article, I gave a glimpse of what HTML is and how to create one, this time around I will give you what the structure of an HTML document looks like.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document has a specific structure that serves as the foundation for every webpage. Below is an example of one;

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. In modern web development, HTML5 is the latest version.
    
* `<html>`: The root element that wraps the entire HTML content.
    
* `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, character set, and linked stylesheets.
    
* `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
    
* `<body>`: Encloses the main content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.
    

### Meta Tags (`<meta>`):

Meta tags provide metadata(more description) about the HTML document. Some common `<meta>` tags include:

* `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the document.
    
* `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Defines the viewport settings for responsive web design.
    

By now you should be familiar with how an `HTML` page is structured.
