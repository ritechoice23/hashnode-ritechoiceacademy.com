JavaScript is a versatile and popular programming language widely used for web development. This guide will introduce you to the basics of JavaScript programming. By the end of this guide, you should be ready to move on to intermediate JavaScript concepts.

## Installing JavaScript

JavaScript is built into most web browsers, so you don't need to install it separately. You can write and run JavaScript code directly in your browser's console or use a text editor to create `.js` files and include them in HTML files.

## Executing JavaScript Code

### 1\. Running JavaScript in the Browser Console

You can run JavaScript code interactively using your browser's console. Open your browser, press `F12` or right-click on a webpage and select "Inspect," then go to the "Console" tab. Type JavaScript code directly and see the results immediately.

```jsx
console.log("Hello, World!");

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Hello, World!

```

### 2\. Running JavaScript in HTML Files

You can write JavaScript code in an HTML file using the `<script>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

### 3\. Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

IDEs provide a convenient environment for writing and executing JavaScript code, with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and WebStorm.

## JavaScript Basics

### Hello, World!

Let's start with the classic first program.

```jsx
console.log("Hello, World!");

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Hello, World!

```

This line of code prints "Hello, World!" to the console. The `console.log` function is used to display text in the console.

### Variables

Variables are used to store data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```jsx
let x = 10;
let y = "Hello";
console.log(x);
console.log(y);

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
10
Hello

```

### Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

```jsx
let age = 25; // Number
let isStudent = true; // Boolean
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]; // Array
let person = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" }; // Object

console.log(typeof age); // number
console.log(typeof isStudent); // boolean
console.log(typeof fruits); // object
console.log(typeof person); // object

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
number
boolean
object
object

```

### Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations.

```jsx
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x + y);  // Addition
console.log(x - y);  // Subtraction
console.log(x * y);  // Multiplication
console.log(x / y);  // Division
console.log(x % y);  // Modulus (Remainder)
console.log(x ** y); // Exponentiation
console.log(Math.floor(x / y)); // Floor division

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
15
5
50
2
0
100000
2

```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values.

```jsx
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x == y);  // Equal to
console.log(x != y);  // Not equal to
console.log(x > y);   // Greater than
console.log(x < y);   // Less than
console.log(x >= y);  // Greater than or equal to
console.log(x <= y);  // Less than or equal to

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
false
true
true
false
true
false

```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.

```jsx
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a && b); // Logical AND
console.log(a || b); // Logical OR
console.log(!a);     // Logical NOT

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
false
true
false

```

## Control Flow

### If Statements

If statements execute a block of code based on a specified condition.

```jsx
let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else if (x === 5) {
    console.log("x is 5");
} else {
    console.log("x is less than 5");
}

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
x is greater than 5

```

### Loops

### For Loop

A for loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

```jsx
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(fruits[i]);
}

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
apple
banana
cherry

```

### While Loop

A while loop repeats a code block as long as a specified condition is true.

```jsx
let i = 1;

while (i < 6) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
1
2
3
4
5

```

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```jsx
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

console.log(greet("Alice"));

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Hello, Alice!

```

## Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

```jsx
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Accessing the first element

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
apple

```

## Objects

Objects are collections of key-value pairs, allowing you to group related data.

```jsx
let car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Corolla",
    year: 2021
};

console.log(car.make);

```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Toyota

```
