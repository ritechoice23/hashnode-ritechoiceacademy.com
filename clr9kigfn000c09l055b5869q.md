HTML is an acronym that stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage

## Role of HTML in web development

HTML is a language used to structure a webpage, an HTML file will always have a file extension of `.html`.

It forms the backbone of web pages by defining the structure and content. **While HTML alone primarily focuses on the structure** **of the content**, it works in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, creating a dynamic and visually appealing user experience.

Let's say you want to write a web page that displays your name and your bio, what you will do is create and write in it a bunch of text as follows.

```plaintext
MY PROFILE
Name:ritechoice23
Bio:I am a web developer with more that 10 years experience working with
languages like  php, laravel, tailwindcss, react js, vue js and more.
```

as written above if you save this file `.html` and you open it with your browser, it will open and display for you the following information but a typical webpage will often have a structure that I am going to write about in my next post.

one thing I want to achieve in this post is to let you know what HTML is.

If you have any questions or contributions kindly post in the comment.
