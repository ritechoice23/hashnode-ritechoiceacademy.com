Many people are interested in kickstarting a career in web development and don't know where to start, well the best point to start is to start from the very beginning.

## Who is a web developer?

A web developer possesses the relevant skills to develop and maintain a website/web app.

## What do I need to become a Web developer?

If you are interested in frontend development I. e the aspect of the web that deals with what the user sees, you will need to master the following.

1. HTML
    
2. CSS
    
3. JavaScript
    
4. A frontend framework/Library e.g ReactJs, VueJs, or any other alternatives
    

If you are going for backend development, that is the server-side aspect, which focuses on business and data handling logic, you need to master any of the following.

### Server Side Languages

1. PHP
    
2. Node Js
    
3. Python
    
4. Golang and more
    

### Databases

1. Relational (MySQL, Postgres DB)
    
2. NoSQL (Mongo DB)
    

On a general note, you need to understand the use of a version control system Like GIT and Github, the basic operation of a Linux environment.

## How long will it take to master the skill?

What I will say is for you to master things is a function of two things, time and what you have built over and over.

so I will say, on average under six months of diligent work and learning, you should be able to step into a Junior developer role.

One advice I will give is this, as you begin your learning start building things, by so doing you are building your strength for mastery.
