Ever wondered how dynamic websites work? Websites that greet you by name, recommend products, or store your shopping cart? The magic behind them is often PHP, a powerful scripting language.

## What is PHP?

PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It seamlessly integrates with HTML to create interactive web experiences.

### **Brief History of PHP**

Born in the mid-1990s, PHP has come a long way from its humble origins. Originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP was initially a simple set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming language. Over time, it evolved into a robust scripting language with a vast community of developers contributing to its growth.
