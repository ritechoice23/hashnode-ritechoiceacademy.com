As a web developer, understanding HTTP status codes is crucial for troubleshooting and ensuring smooth client-server communication. Here’s a quick guide to the most important ones you need to keep in mind:

### 1\. 200 OK:

This means your request was successful, and the server returned the desired response.

### 2\. 201 Created:

A new resource has been successfully created as a result of the request.

### 3\. 202 Accepted:

The request has been accepted for processing, but the operation is not yet completed.

### 4\. 204 No Content:

The server successfully processed the request, but there’s no content to send back.

### 5\. 301 Moved Permanently:

The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.

### 6\. 302 Found:

The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.

### 7\. 304 Not Modified:

The cached version of the resource is still valid, so no new data is returned.

### 8\. 400 Bad Request:

There’s something wrong with the request, and the server can’t process it.

### 9\. 401 Unauthorized:

Authentication is required to access the resource.

### 10\. 403 Forbidden:

You’re not allowed to access the requested resource, even with authentication.

### 11\. 404 Not Found:

The server couldn’t find the requested resource.

### 12\. 405 Method Not Allowed:

The request method is not supported for the resource.

### 13\. 408 Request Timeout:

The server timed out waiting for the client’s request.

### 14\. 500 Internal Server Error:

Something went wrong on the server, and it’s unable to complete the request.

### 15\. 501 Not Implemented:

The server doesn’t support the functionality required to fulfill the request.

### 16\. 502 Bad Gateway:

The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.

### 17\. 503 Service Unavailable:

The server is currently unavailable, usually due to maintenance or overload.

### 18\. 504 Gateway Timeout:

The gateway server didn’t receive a response in time from an upstream server.

Understanding these status codes helps you quickly identify issues during development, making debugging smoother and more efficient.
