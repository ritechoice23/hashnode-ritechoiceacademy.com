To start your coding journey particularly being a web developer, below are a simplified details of some essential setup you must have.

## Web Browser

A web browser should not be included in this list but i did because i assume i am communication to an absolute beginner, so you must download a modern web browser like chrome for the preview of your website.

## Code Editor

To write your code, you need to download and install a code editor, as a beginner I will not state many option, just proceed and install VS code via the link below.

## VS code Extension

As much as i am trying to keep things short and simple, I will like to include this extension to keep your page auto refreshing as you write your code.

Install Live Server with the below link.
